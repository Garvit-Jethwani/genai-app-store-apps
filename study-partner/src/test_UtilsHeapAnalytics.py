### Scenario 1: HEAP Analytics Not Loaded When Environment Variable Missing
Details:
  TestName: test_heap_analytics_without_heap_id_env_variable
  Description: Confirm that the function does not generate a script when the required HEAP_ID environment variable is missing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the "HEAP_ID" environment variable is not set.
  Act: Call the `heap_analytics` function without setting the "HEAP_ID" environment variable.
  Assert: The function should return `None`.
Validation:
  Tests the functionâ€™s responsibility to conditionally execute based on the presence of required environment variables. Validates proper handling of missing configurations.

### Scenario 2: HEAP Analytics Script Initialization With Environment Variable
Details:
  TestName: test_heap_analytics_with_heap_id_env_variable
  Description: Verify that the function properly initializes the heap analytics script when the "HEAP_ID" environment variable is present.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the "HEAP_ID" environment variable to a test value.
  Act: Call the `heap_analytics` function with a valid `userid`.
  Assert: Validate that the returned string includes the initialization script for the specified "HEAP_ID".
Validation:
  Ensures that the script is properly formatted and initialized with the correct HEAP_ID, allowing client-side analytics to function as expected.

### Scenario 3: User Identification in HEAP Analytics
Details:
  TestName: test_heap_analytics_identify_user
  Description: Ensure that the function generates the correct hashed user identity when provided with a `userid`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set "HEAP_ID" and provide a `userid`.
  Act: Call the `heap_analytics` function with a `userid`.
  Assert: Validate that the script includes a hashed user identity and that the SHA256 hash is correctly computed and integrated into the script.
Validation:
  This scenario validates the function's ability to correctly identify different users in a way that protects their privacy but still allows for individualized tracking analytics.

### Scenario 4: Adding Event Properties
Details:
  TestName: test_heap_analytics_add_event_properties
  Description: Verify the function's ability to append provided event properties to the analytics script.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set "HEAP_ID" and provide `event_properties`.
  Act: Call the `heap_analytics` function with both `userid` and `event_properties`.
  Assert: Check that the returned script includes the correct `addEventProperties` method call with the provided properties.
Validation:
  This test checks whether the function handles additional event data properly, which is essential for event tracking customization and accuracy in analytics.

### Scenario 5: Handling None UserID
Details:
  TestName: test_heap_analytics_none_userid
  Description: Checks how the function behaves when `userid` is None, ensuring it doesn't attempt to identify the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set "HEAP_ID" and pass `userid` as `None`.
  Act: Call the `heap_analytics` function with `None` as `userid`.
  Assert: The user identity code (`heap.identify`) should not be present in the script.
Validation:
  Confirms that the script behaves correctly in scenarios where user identification should not be occurred, preventing errors or unintended misuse of user identification methods.

Each of these scenarios will ensure that `heap_analytics` functions effectively and handles both typical use cases and edge conditions respecting business logic and environment setup.
